    <string name="Acrocyanosis_history">Acrocyanosis is persistent blue or cyanotic discoloration of the extremities, most commonly occurring in the hands, although it also occurs in the feet and distal parts of face. Although described over 100 years ago and not uncommon in practice, the nature of this phenomenon is still uncertain.</string>
    <string name="Acroparesthesia_history">The condition was named acroparesthesia in 1890 and, in the following years, was accepted as a disease in medical textbooks. Almost all of the patients with acroparesthesia, described at the end of the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century, would today be diagnosed with idiopathic CTS.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Myocarditis_history">Patients with myocarditis have a clinical history of acute decompensation of heart failure, but they have no other underlying cardiac dysfunction or have low cardiac risk. The diagnosis is usually presumptive, based on patient demographics and the clinical course (eg, spontaneous recovery following supportive care).</string>
    <string name="Cardiomegaly_history">Cardiomegaly (sometimes megacardia or megalocardia) is a medical condition in which the heart is enlarged. As such, it is more commonly referred to simply as "having an enlarged heart". It is usually the result of underlying conditions that make the heart work harder, such as obesity, heart valve disease, high blood pressure (hypertension), and coronary artery disease. Cardiomyopathy is also associated with cardiomegaly.</string>
    <string name="Dressler_history">Not to be confused with DRESS Syndrome. <b>Dressler syndrome</b> is a secondary form of pericarditis that occurs in the setting of injury to the heart or the pericardium (the outer lining of the heart). It consists of fever, pleuritic pain, pericarditis and/or a pericardial effusion. Dressler syndrome is also known as postmyocardial infarction syndrome and the term is sometimes used to refer to post-pericardiotomy pericarditis. It was first characterized by William Dressler at Maimonides Medical Center in 1956. It should not be confused with the Dressler\'s syndrome of haemoglobinuria named for Lucas Dressler, who characterized it in 1854.</string>
    <string name="Acrodermatitis_Enteropathic_history">Acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE) is a disorder of zinc metabolism that occurs in one of three forms: an inborn (congenital) form and two acquired forms. The inborn form of AE is a rare genetic disorder characterized by intestinal abnormalities that lead to the inability to absorb zinc from the intestine.</string>
    <string name="Allergic_Dermatitis_history">Allergic contact dermatitis occurs when a substance to which you\'re sensitive (allergen) triggers an immune reaction in your skin. It often affects only the area that came into contact with the allergen.</string>
    <string name="Erythrasma_history">Erythrasma is a bacterial infection of the skin typically caused by Corynebacterium minutissimum. This pathogen infects the stratum corneum in warm and wet areas of the skin. Most commonly, the axillary, inguinal, and interdigital regions are affected.</string>
    <string name="Black_Piedra_history">Black piedra is a fungal infection of the hair shafts. It is also known as Trichomycosis nodosa. The fungal elements are attached to the hair shaft to form nodules along the hair shaft. It predominantly affects scalp hair, although involvement of the beard, mustache, and pubic hairs is also known.</string>
    <string name="Nevus_history">(NEE-vus) A benign (not cancer) growth on the skin that is formed by a cluster of melanocytes (cells that make a substance called melanin, which gives color to skin and eyes). A nevus is usually dark and may be raised from the skin. Also called mole.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Respiratory_Failure"> Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) occurs when fluid builds up in the tiny, elastic air sacs (alveoli) in your lungs. The fluid keeps your lungs from filling with enough air, which means less oxygen reaches your bloodstream. This deprives your organs of the oxygen they need to function.</string>
    <string name="Addisonian_Crisis">An addisonian crisis is a life-threatening situation that results in low blood pressure, low blood levels of sugar and high blood levels of potassium. You will need immediate medical care. People with Addison\'s disease commonly have associated autoimmune diseases.</string>
    <string name="Cardiac_Arrest">Sudden cardiac arrest is the abrupt loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. The condition usually results from a problem with your heart\'s electrical system, which disrupts your heart\'s pumping action and stops blood flow to your body.</string>
    <string name="Diabetic_Coma">A diabetic coma is a life-threatening disorder that causes unconsciousness. If you have diabetes, dangerously high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) or dangerously low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can lead to a diabetic coma.</string>
    <string name="Thyroid_Crysis">Thyroid storm (also called thyroid crisis and thyrotoxic crisis) happens when your thyroid gland releases a large amount of thyroid hormone in a short amount of time. It\'s a rare complication of hyperthyroidism. Thyroid storm is a medical emergency and is life-threatening.</string>
    <string name="Acromegaly">Acromegaly is a rare condition where the body produces too much growth hormone, causing body tissues and bones to grow more quickly. Over time, this leads to abnormally large hands and feet, and a wide range of other symptoms. Acromegaly is usually diagnosed in adults aged 30 to 50, but it can affect people of any age.</string>
    <string name="Addisons_Disease">Addison\'s disease, also called adrenal insufficiency, is an uncommon disorder that occurs when your body doesn\'t produce enough of certain hormones. In Addison\'s disease, your adrenal glands, located just above your kidneys, produce too little cortisol and, often, too little aldosterone.</string>
    <string name="Carcinoid_Syndrome">A carcinoid tumour is a rare cancer of the neuroendocrine system – the body system that produces hormones. The tumour usually grows in the bowels or appendix, but it can also be found in the stomach, pancreas, lung, breast, kidney, ovaries or testicles.</string>
    <string name="Cushings_Disease">Cushing disease (also called Cushing\'s disease) occurs when your body makes too much cortisol, a hormone related to the body\'s stress response. It\'s a rare pituitary disorder that is progressive. That means that without treatment, it gets worse over time.</string>
    <string name="Nelson_Syndrome">Nelson\'s syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs in some patients with Cushing\'s disease patients as a result of removing both adrenal glands. In Nelson\'s syndrome, the pituitary tumor continues to grow and release the hormone ACTH.</string>
    <string name="Abscess_Of_Liver">A liver abscess is defined as a pus-filled mass in the liver that can develop from injury to the liver or from an intra-abdominal infection disseminated from the portal vein. The majority of these abscesses are categorized as pyogenic or amoebic, although a minority are caused by parasites and fungi.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Gastric_Dilation">Acute gastric dilatation is the radiological finding of a massively enlarged stomach as seen on plain film X-ray or a computerized tomography scan of the abdomen. It is a rare entity with high mortality if not treated promptly and is often not reported due to a lack of physician awareness.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Hepatitis_A">It is spread when someone unknowingly ingests the virus — even in microscopic amounts — through close personal contact with an infected person or through eating contaminated food or drink. Symptoms of hepatitis A can last up to 2 months and include fatigue, nausea, stomach pain, and jaundice.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Hepatitis_B">Acute hepatitis B is a short-term illness that occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis B virus. Some people with acute hepatitis B have no symptoms at all or only mild illness. For others, acute hepatitis B causes a more severe illness that requires hospitalization.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Hepatitis_C">Hepatitis C is often described as \"acute,\" meaning a new infection, or \"chronic,\" meaning long-term infection. Acute hepatitis C occurs within the first 6 months after someone is exposed to the hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C can be a short-term illness, but for most people, acute infection leads to chronic infection.</string>
    <string name="Acute_Hepatitis_E">Hepatitis E is a liver disease caused by the hepatitis E virus (HEV). Although rare in developed countries, hepatitis E is widespread in the developing world. In the vast majority of people, HEV infection results in a self-limited, acute illness.</string>

    <string name="Atrial_Septal_Defect">An atrial septal defect is a birth defect of the heart in which there is a hole in the wall (septum) that divides the upper chambers (atria) of the heart. A hole can vary in size and may close on its own or may require surgery. An atrial septal defect is one type of congenital heart defect.</string>
    <string name="Coarctation_Of_Aorta">What is Coarctation of the Aorta? Coarctation of the aorta is a birth defect in which a part of the aorta is narrower than usual. If the narrowing is severe enough and if it is not diagnosed, the baby may have serious problems and may need surgery or other procedures soon after birth.</string>
    <string name="Heart_Failure">Heart failure means that the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly. It usually happens because the heart has become too weak or stiff. It\'s sometimes called congestive heart failure, although this name is not widely used now. Heart failure does not mean your heart has stopped working.</string>
    <string name="Kawasaki_Disease">Kawasaki disease causes swelling (inflammation) in children in the walls of small to medium-sized blood vessels that carry blood throughout the body. Kawasaki disease commonly leads to inflammation of the coronary arteries, which supply oxygen-rich blood to the heart.</string>
    <string name="Mitral_Regurgitation">Sometimes a baby is born with a defective mitral valve. In other cases, certain heart or health problems can lead to a weakened mitral valve during childhood or adulthood. Rheumatic fever, an acquired disease, can also cause scarring in the heart tissue resulting in mitral stenosis or regurgitation.</string>
    <string name="Atopic_Eczema">Atopic eczema (atopic dermatitis) is the most common form of eczema, a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, dry and cracked. Atopic eczema is more common in children, often developing before their first birthday. But it may also develop for the first time in adults.</string>
    <string name="Impetigo_in_Children">Impetigo (im-puh-TIE-go) is a common and highly contagious skin infection that mainly affects infants and young children. It usually appears as reddish sores on the face, especially around the nose and mouth and on the hands and feet. Over about a week, the sores burst and develop honey-colored crusts.</string>
    <string name="Nevus_in_Children">A congenital nevus, also known as a mole, is a type of pigmented birthmark that appears at birth or during a baby\'s first year. These occur in 1% to 2% of the population. These moles are frequently found on the trunk or limbs, although they can appear anywhere on the body.</string>
    <string name="Pityriasis_Versicolor">Pityriasis versicolor is a common infection of the epidermis in adults, but only a few cases of this infection (especially the hypopigmented type) have been reported in infants aged under one year. Herein, we document a report of these cases and a review of the literature. Two patients with infantile pityriasis versicolor, who presented with hypopigmented macules on the neck, upper back, and chest are reported.</string>
    <string name="Psoriasis_In_Children">Children can have mild, moderate, or severe psoriasis. It\'s a lifelong condition with no cure, but you can treat the symptoms with medication. Most pediatric cases of psoriasis are mild and get better with treatment. Psoriasis isn't contagious.</string>
    <string name="Achondroplasia">Achondroplasia is a genetic condition affecting a protein in the body called the fibroblast growth factor receptor. In achondroplasia, this protein begins to function abnormally, slowing down the growth of bone in the cartilage of the growth plate.</string>
    <string name="Beckers_Muscular_Dystrophy">Becker muscular dystrophy (often called Becker MD or BMD) is a form of muscular dystrophy, a genetic disorder that gradually makes the body\'s muscles weaker and smaller. It causes less severe problems than the most common type, Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</string>
    <string name="Osteogenesis_Imperfecta">Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is an inherited (genetic) bone disorder that is present at birth. It is also known as brittle bone disease. A child born with OI may have soft bones that break (fracture) easily, bones that are not formed normally, and other problems. Signs and symptoms may range from mild to severe.</string>
    <string name="Sturge_Weber_Syndrome">Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS), also called encephalotrigeminal angiomatosis, is a neurocutaneous disorder with angiomas that involve the leptomeninges (leptomeningeal angiomas [LAs]) and the skin of the face, typically in the ophthalmic (V1) and maxillary (V2) distributions of the trigeminal nerve. The hallmark of SWS is a facial cutaneous venous dilation, also referred to as a nevus flammeus or port-wine stain (PWS).</string>
    <string name="Trisomy_21">Trisomy 21 is the most common chromosomal anomaly in humans, affecting about 5,000 babies born each year and more than 350,000 people in the United States. \n\nAlso known as Down syndrome, trisomy 21 is a genetic condition caused by an extra chromosome. Most babies inherit 23 chromosomes from each parent, for a total of 46 chromosomes. Babies with Down syndrome however, end up with three chromosomes at position 21, instead of the usual pair.</string>
    <string name="Sequelae_Of_Rickets">Rickets is the softening and weakening of bones in children, usually because of an extreme and prolonged vitamin D deficiency. Rare inherited problems also can cause rickets. \n\nVitamin D helps your child's body absorb calcium and phosphorus from food. Not enough vitamin D makes it difficult to maintain proper calcium and phosphorus levels in bones, which can cause rickets.</string>
    <string name="Vitamin_A_Deficiency">Vitamin deficiency is the condition of a long-term lack of a vitamin. When caused by not enough vitamin intake it is classified as a primary deficiency, whereas when due to an underlying disorder such as malabsorption it is called a secondary deficiency.</string>
    <string name="Intussusception">Intussusception (in-tuh-suh-SEP-shun) is a serious condition in which part of the intestine slides into an adjacent part of the intestine. This telescoping action often blocks food or fluid from passing through. Intussusception also cuts off the blood supply to the part of the intestine that\'s affected.</string>
    <string name="Achalasia_Cardia">Achalasia is an esophageal motility disorder characterized by failure of lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxation and is rare in children. The most common symptoms are vomiting, dysphagia, regurgitation, and weight loss. Definitive diagnosis is made with barium swallow study and esophageal manometry.</string>
